# `PlanMyTrip Challenge`


 ## `Project Overview ` 
 
 
In this project for PlanMyTrip app, I added the weather description to the weather data that I have already retrieved in this module. Then I had the beta testers used input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. From the list of potential travel destinations, the beta testers chose four cities to create a travel itinerary. Finally, using the Google Maps Directions API, I created a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map. <br/>
 #### Resources

## `Summary`


First, I generated a set of 2,000 random latitudes and longitudes, retrieved the nearest city, and performed an API call with the OpenWeatherMap. In addition to the city weather data, I gathered in the current weather description for each city. <br/>
